# Security & Safety Checklist — Biomechanical Craft

This checklist summarizes practical hardening and operational controls. Use it as a base for policy documents, procurement, and implementation.

1. Threat Model & Principles
- Define assets: control channels, capsule/mesh servers, actuation modules, firmware, neural input streams, telemetry, charging systems.
- Apply least privilege, defense-in-depth, strong identity, and secure supply chain practices.

2. Identity & Authentication
- Per-device hardware root-of-trust (TPM / secure element).
- Mutual TLS with client certs for all mesh/capsule server connections.
- Per-device keys provisioned securely at manufacture or during trusted enrollment.
- Use short-lived credentials and automated rotation.

3. Firmware & Boot
- Secure Boot + measured boot that records boot measurements.
- Enforce signed firmware images with verified signatures before activation.
- Rollback protection and reproducible signing pipeline.

4. Command & Actuation Controls
- Require cryptographic command signing for all actuation (attach/detach, unions).
- Commands include sequence numbers, nonces, and expiry timestamps.
- Implement replay protection and strict sequence enforcement.
- For high-risk commands require multi-authority approval (M-of-N signing) and human-in-the-loop confirmation at the actuator.

5. Neural Input Handling
- Treat raw neural streams as untrusted inputs.
- Add an intent-inference layer that outputs bounded, rate-limited control primitives.
- Enforce validation, smoothing, anomaly detection, and human confirmation for critical state changes.
- Log all neural-derived decisions (with hashes for tamper-evidence).

6. Charging & Power Safety
- Redundant hardware charge controllers with independent thermal and voltage watchdogs.
- Enforce maximum State-of-Charge (SoC) floors/ceilings for operational modes.
- Require signed charge-authorize messages and fail-safe to grounded/disconnected state on anomalies.

7. Network Segmentation & Hardening
- Separate networks: management, control, telemetry, developer.
- Restrict remote access behind bastion hosts and zero-trust overlays.
- Deploy per-subnet firewall policies and service-level allowlists.

8. Monitoring, Detection & Response
- Telemetry-based health checks for motors, battery, sensors, and neural input channels.
- Rate-limit command ingestion; raise alarm on bursts or abnormal command sequences.
- Tamper-evident logging (e.g., append-only logs with chained hashes).
- Maintain an incident playbook and means to place craft into "limp" safe-mode remotely.

9. Physical & Mechanical Safeguards
- Mechanical interlocks for any detach/attach mechanism.
- Multi-factor physical release (two-person rule or mechanical override that requires verification).
- Local cutoff switches independent of software.

10. Supply Chain & Build
- Signed SBOM for all components, secure procurement, provenance checks.
- Reproducible builds and CI that signs artifacts with organizational keys.

11. Testing & Digital Twin
- Maintain a digital twin environment for validating updates before deployment.
- Staged deployment: dev -> test (digital twin) -> shadow (limited hardware) -> full deploy.

12. Operational Governance
- Role-based access with least-privilege for ops and engineers.
- Periodic key rotation, audit, and red-team testing.
- Privacy policy for neural data; default to minimal retention and encrypted storage.

Appendix — Implementation notes
- Use hardware-backed signing (HSM/TPM, KMS) for keys; do not store private keys on developer laptops.
- Design the "limp mode" as minimal dependencies: power down actuators, enable brakes/locks, preserve comms for recovery.
- For any critical actuator, require both software authorization and a secondary hardwired physical safety check.

This checklist is intentionally concise; expand each item into operational procedures, implementation specs, and test cases for your environment.
